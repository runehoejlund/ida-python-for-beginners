2. Follow the installation guide.
3. Check that you have installed it correctly by opening the ​Anaconda Navigator​ program
4. If you encounter any problems, you can get more help here: https://docs.anaconda.com/free/troubleshooting/

**Open the file:**
1. Open Anaconda Navigator from your programs/apps on your computer.
2. Open **Jupyter Notebook** (with the "Launch" button).
3. You will now see an overview of your file system. Navigate to the folder where the file is located and double-click on it to open it.
